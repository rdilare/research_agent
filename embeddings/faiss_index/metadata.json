What is SIR Electoral Roll Bihar: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has begun Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the state' electoral rolls four months prior to the Bihar state elections. The controversy behind this decision can now be heard in the parliament with the monsoon session going on.

What is the SIR Electoral Roll? House-to-house enumeration is used to prepare new electoral rolls as part of an extensive revision. Without consulting current rolls, enumerators visit each home to list eligible voters as of qualifying date. This is carried out when the ECI concludes that the current rolls need to be completely rebuilt or are erroneous. This usually happens prior to significant elections or following administrative procedures like constituency delimitation. SIR Electoral Roll in Bihar Latest Updates: Check for the latest updates regarding SIR Electoral Roll process being carried out in Bihar for the upcoming legislative assembly election: - August 11, 2025: The Supreme Court has been informed by the Election Commission of India (ECI) that it is not required by law to compile or publish separate list of the almost 6.5 million names that are not on Bihar' draft electoral rolls or to provide an explanation for their exclusion. This reply was in response to petition filed by an NGO, ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms). - August 1, 2025: After completing month-long Special Intensive Revision (SIR) effort in preparation for the next Assembly elections, the Election Commission (EC) has released the first draft electoral rolls for Bihar on Friday.

Approximately 65 lakh lakh voters are expected to be removed from the list Why in the News? The first phase of the SIR electoral roll has finally been completed, as announced by the ECI.

    "text": "Times of India SC to take up SIR today: 35 lakh voters untraceable, opposition mounts pressure on govt \u2013 controversy explained in 10 points | India News - Times of India NEW DELHI: political and legal battle is underway over the Election Commission\u2019 Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar. What was intended as technical exercise to improve the accuracy of voter lists has escalated into flashpoint in both Parliament and the Supreme Court, with opposition parties alleging disenfranchisement and voter fraud, while the poll body insists it is necessary step to uphold electoral integrity. The Supreme Court is set to hear petition today challenging the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, as the Opposition intensifies its attack on the government over the exercise. Led by the Congress, opposition parties have accused the Centre of using the revision process to target voters just months before the state heads to elections. The row over SIR has gained fresh momentum in Parliament as well, with protests disrupting proceedings of the House over the past week. Here is the controversy explained in 10 points: What is the Special Intensive Revision (SIR)? The Election Commission of India (ECI) launched the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar on June 24. As per the centre, the objective was to update and clean up the electoral roll through house-to-house verification by Booth Level Officers (BLOs). The last such exercise in the state was conducted in 2003. With Bihar undergoing rapid urbanisation, youth enrolment, and internal migration, the ECI said the revision was crucial for ensuring accurate rolls ahead of state elections. Why SIR became flashpoint in Parliament While the Monsoon session was set to debate Operation Sindoor, the SIR exercise quickly became parallel point of contention. INDIA bloc MPs have submitted multiple notices demanding discussion on the matter, alleging that the SIR was being used to remove genuine voters from rolls. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju clarified that the Operation Sindoor debate would take priority, pushing SIR-related discussions to later date \u2014 decision that drew strong reactions from the Opposition. Supreme Court steps in The Supreme Court is hearing batch of pleas challenging the SIR. Petitioners argue that the exercise lacks legal safeguards and risks disenfranchising large swathes of the population. The lead petitioner, NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), claimed the exercise is \"arbitrary\" and violates Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The court has also questioned the exclusion of Aadhaar and ration cards as valid ID for voter verification. Massive participation or mass fraud? According to the EC, the SIR saw over 7.24 crore of Bihar\u2019 7.89 crore electors participate, turnout rate of nearly 92%. However, multiple affidavits and field reports challenge this figure, suggesting enumeration forms were uploaded en masse by BLOs without voter consent. ADR and other petitioners claimed that even dead people were shown to have submitted forms, raising concerns of systemic fraud to meet internal targets. 35 lakh voters untraceable In its latest press note dated July 27, the Election Commission clarified the status of the",

ADR and other petitioners claimed that even dead people were shown to have submitted forms, raising concerns of systemic fraud to meet internal targets. 35 lakh voters untraceable In its latest press note dated July 27, the Election Commission clarified the status of the 35 lakh voters flagged as missing. According to the ECI, many were found to have moved to other states or union territories, some were deceased, others did not submit their enumeration forms, and few were simply not willing to register. The Commission emphasised that their exact status will be confirmed only after scrutiny by EROs and AEROs by 1 August. Importantly, all genuine electors can still be added during the claims and objections period starting 1 August. Online, SMS, and volunteer outreach used to reach every voter Over 5.7 crore SMSes were sent to registered mobile numbers, 29 lakh forms were submitted digitally, and BLOs made multiple home visits. Volunteers also assisted senior citizens, PwDs, and vulnerable groups in accessing forms and filing appeals, with training provided for redressal mechanisms. Claims and objections window opens August 1 The EC has said that no name will be deleted without \u201cspeaking order\u201d and due notice. The draft rolls will be published on August 1, and electors or parties can file claims or objections till September 1. Appeals can be made to the District Magistrate or CEO if needed. EC says all major political parties consulted In detailed affidavit to the Supreme Court, the ECI defended the SIR as essential for removing ineligible voters and ensuring free and fair elections. Citing Articles 326 and provisions of the Representation of People Act, the Commission insisted it was fulfilling its constitutional duty. EC also claimed all major political parties were consulted and that over 1.5 lakh Booth Level Agents were deployed. However, the ADR contested that no political party had asked for complete overhaul.

    "text": "BBC Explained: Why is the opposition protesting against India's election commission? The row over 'vote theft' that has shaken Indian politics political row has erupted in India over allegations of \"vote theft\", with opposition parties accusing the country' election body of irregularities, which they say favoured the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 general elections. On Tuesday, parliament was adjourned after opposition MPs demanded debate on the integrity of India' electoral process. day earlier, dozens of opposition leaders, including Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, were briefly detained by the police in the capital Delhi, as they tried to march to the Election Commission of India' (ECI) headquarters. Gandhi first raised the issue at 7 August press conference in Delhi, and has since managed to galvanise strong support from hundreds of opposition lawmakers. The Election Commission and the BJP have aggressively rejected the allegations. What are Rahul Gandhi' allegations against the Election Commission? Gandhi has alleged widespread voter manipulation during the 2024 parliamentary elections, citing granular data obtained from the electoral body itself - though the ECI and the ruling party dispute his interpretation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi secured historic third term in the elections, but his BJP-led alliance fell short of the sweeping majority predicted. Voter turnout averaged 66% in the world' largest election, with nearly billion registered voters - one in eight people on Earth. Gandhi cited electoral data for Mahadevapura, part of the Bangalore Central parliamentary constituency, and claimed that the voter list had more than 100,000 manipulated entries, including duplicate voters, invalid addresses, and bulk registrations of votes at single locations. He presented examples of voters like Shakun Rani, who he claimed cast her ballots twice - claim disputed by the election body. Gandhi also alleged CCTV footage from polling booths was deleted and pointed out an instance of 80 people registered in single address in Mahadevapura. The Congress leader says his party lost at least 48 seats in the elections due to such irregularities and has accused India' election body of failing to enforce the \"one man, one vote\" principle. The Congress won 99 of the 543 seats in the elections, behind BJP' 240. Gandhi has demanded that the ECI release digital voter rolls, so that they can be audited by his party and the public. The BBC hasn' independently verified Gandhi' claims. What have the ECI and BJP said? Soon after Gandhi' press conference, ECI responded on social media platform , calling his allegations \"absurd\" and denying many of his claims. The polling body has demanded that he either submit signed declaration under oath or apologise to the nation. ECI' Karnataka state unit further said that the Congress didn' file formal objections when the electoral roll was being revised ahead of the 2024 parliamentary elections. The poll body earlier said it keeps CCTV footage only for 45 days after results - the window for filing election disputes. BJP leaders have also strongly rebutted the allegations. \"This anarchy is extremely worrying and dangerous for democracy,\" BJP leader and federal education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.

BJP leaders have also strongly rebutted the allegations. \"This anarchy is extremely worrying and dangerous for democracy,\" BJP leader and federal education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. Federal agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said Gandhi and the opposition alliance were \"defaming democracy, tearing it to shreds, and tampering with the dignity of constitutional institutions\". What has been the political fallout? Gandhi' allegations have led to an uproar as they come in the backdrop of controversy over month-long revision of electoral rolls in Bihar state, where key elections are scheduled for November. The Special Intensive Revision (SIR), held between June and July, saw officials visit all 78.9 million voters in the state for verification - the first update since 2003. The ECI says the drive targets duplicate and deceased voters, but critics say its haste has disenfranchised many, especially migrants and minorities. Many voters in Bihar have told the BBC that the draft rolls have wrong photos and include dead people. India' Supreme Court is currently hearing batch of petitions challenging the SIR, with petitioners demanding publication of the deleted names - about 6.5 million - with reasons for their removal. The election body says deletions include 2.2 million dead, 700,000 enrolled more than once and 3.6 million who have migrated from the state. Corrections are open until 1 September, with over 165,000 applications received. similar review will be conducted nationwide to verify nearly billion voters. The court has said that the allegations of disenfranchisement \"largely appears to be case of trust deficit, nothing else\" and that it would \"step in immediately\" if mass exclusion of voters is proven. On 12 August, Gandhi escalated his claims of vote theft, saying such manipulation was happening \"at national level and systematically\".",

    "text": "Special Intensive Revision (SIR) - ACQ IAS Academy The Supreme Court (SC) is currently reviewing the Election Commission of India\u2019 (ECI) process for the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, suggesting that Aadhaar, voter ID, and ration cards should be accepted as valid documents for voter enumeration. The SC also rejected the argument made by petitioners challenging the ECI' authority to carry out the revision. Electoral Roll (Voter List): It is the official list of all eligible voters in specific constituency. Preparation: The ECI prepares electoral rolls under the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1950. Eligibility: Voters must be citizens aged 18 or above and ordinarily resident in the constituency. Exclusions: Non-citizens and individuals disqualified by law are excluded. SIR Process: time-bound, house-to-house verification conducted by Booth Level Officers (BLOs) to ensure accuracy in voter rolls before major elections. Focus: The process aims to correct errors, add new voters, and remove ineligible voters from the list. Legal Framework: Section 21 of the RP Act empowers the ECI to conduct special revisions. Article 324: Grants the ECI the power to oversee and control the preparation of electoral rolls. Article 326: Guarantees universal adult suffrage. Judicial Precedent: In Mohinder Singh Gill . Chief Election Commissioner (1977), the SC upheld the broad powers of the ECI to ensure fair elections, limiting judicial interference under Article 329( ). Purpose: To remove ghost voters, include newly eligible voters, and ensure voter list accuracy. Re-registration: Addresses migration and shifting populations, aligning the voter list with constituency changes. \"One Person, One Vote\": Ensures each eligible voter is represented fairly, removing duplicates and false entries. Civic Participation: Promotes awareness and offers accessible registration options (door-to-door surveys, online). Digital Integration: Supports initiatives like mobile -voting ( . ., Bihar' -SECBHR app) using blockchain, biometric scanning, and facial recognition. Impact on Vulnerable Voters: Requiring documents like Aadhaar, ration cards, and voter IDs may disproportionately affect underprivileged voters, especially those without access to these documents. Frequent Moves: Migrants, students, and seasonal laborers may struggle to prove residency, risking exclusion from voter lists. Birth Certificates/Legacy Data: The use of documents such as birth certificates raises concerns that it could lead to de facto citizenship test, discriminating against marginalized and minority groups. Top-Down Implementation: Excessive documentation requirements could undermine universal suffrage, especially for illiterate and homeless populations. Aadhaar as Proof of Residence: While not proof of citizenship, Aadhaar should be accepted as valid document for residency verification. This can be cross-verified with legacy data. Aadhaar-Voter ID Linking: transparent linking process with safeguards can improve accuracy. Door-to-Door Verification: BLOs should conduct thorough door-to-door verification, and regular audits should be carried out by state election commissions. The ECI should consult civil society organizations, engage in public awareness campaigns, and ensure judicial oversight of the process to guarantee transparency. AI for Anomaly Detection: Using AI to flag suspicious voter list deletions or additions, and blockchain to ensure secure voter logs. Real-Time Tracking: real-time tracking dashboard can help prevent tampering and irregularities. Special Camps for Marginalized Groups: Organize camps for tribals, disabled persons, and",

Special Camps for Marginalized Groups: Organize camps for tribals, disabled persons, and other marginalized communities. Multilingual Helplines: Provide language support to reach diverse communities. Post-Revision Surveys: To ensure that the revision is accurate and that no groups are unjustly excluded. The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) is critical for ensuring error-free elections and fair democratic process. While the Supreme Court upheld the Election Commission of India' (ECI) authority, concerns about disenfranchisement, bias, and the potential misuse of documents like Aadhaar persist. Strengthening the SIR process through inclusive documentation, technology, and public consultation can help ensure that the process is fair, transparent, and equitable, safeguarding the integrity of India' electoral system.

    "text": "Conduct SIR across the country, not selectively... | morungexpress.com IANS Photo Kolkata, August 13 (IANS): Trinamool Congress General Secretary and the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, Abhishek Banerjee, has dared the BJP-led Central government to immediately dissolve the Lok Sabha and conduct Special Intensive Revision (SIR) by the Election Commission of India (ECI) across the country and not selectively in poll-bound states. Using his social media handle, Banerjee said people of the country have been betrayed after the Election Commission claimed the voters' list in various states is filled with irregularities. \"The EC has stated that the voter lists across various states on the basis of which the GENERAL ELECTIONS were held barely year ago in 2024 are FAULTY and riddled with IRREGULARITIES,\" he said. \"If that is indeed the case, and if the GoI agrees with the EC\u2019 assessment, then the first step towards conducting genuine SIR and STANDING ON MORAL HIGH GROUND is the IMMEDIATE DISSOLUTION OF LOK SABHA. If one truly supports the idea of SIR, then as per the EC\u2019 own statement - THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN BETRAYED,\" said the Trinamool Congress leader. He also urged the Election Commission to conduct SIR across the country. \"Also, If the new CEC is truly as competent as claimed, then the SIR should be implemented across the country, not selectively in poll-bound states,\" he said. Banerjee on Tuesday said the SIR proposed by the ECI was acceptable only if the current Parliament is dissolved. He said that if he agreed that SIR was necessary since there were manipulations in the voters\u2019 list, then it should also be accepted that the last Lok Sabha elections were conducted with that manipulated voters\u2019 list. \"So the current Parliament should be dismantled. Since the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister were elected by that manipulated voters' list, they should also resign. In the meantime, there were Assembly elections in some states, with manipulated voters' list. So the Assemblies in those states should also be dismantled,\u201d Banerjee told media persons outside the Kolkata Airport. He said that legal action should be initiated against former Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar since, under his leadership, such elections with 'manipulated voters' list were conducted. The ECI on Monday issued fact-check dismissing as \u201cincorrect\u201d statements issued by agitating Opposition leaders over alleged \"voter list manipulation\".",
